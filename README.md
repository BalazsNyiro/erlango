# erlango


Erlang interpreter - written in Go
State machine replication - Distributed Virtual Machine,
Shared code execution on multiple nodes.

# Goals in the first session:
 - Erlang parser creation with basic language elems
 - Virtual Machine creation to execute the code
 - basic filesystem/string/network handling.

The first session doesn't want to be perfect.
It is a POC, and when it works, the code will be refactored/tuned.
